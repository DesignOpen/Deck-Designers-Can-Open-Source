## History of Open Source Software

1. Richard Stallman and the Printer (http://oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/ch01.html)
2. GNU
	* September 1983 Start of GNU Project (30th anniversary)
		* use
		* study
		* modify
		* redistribute
	* Founded the Free Software Foundation
	* Free as in Freedom, not as in beer.
3. Linux
	* Linus Torvalds
	* 1991 Released as freely modifiable source code
	* February 1992, Torvalds relicensed the project under the GNU General Public License
	* "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"
4. Eric S. Raymond
	* The Cathedral and the Bazaar 
		* Presented in 1997 at a conference
		* Published in 1999
		* The Cathedral model, in which source code is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of software developers. GNU Emacs and GCC are presented as examples.
		* The Bazaar model, in which the code is developed over the Internet in view of the public. Raymond credits Linus Torvalds, leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the Fetchmail project.
	* Frank Hecker - The internal white paper by Frank Hecker that led to the release of the Mozilla (then Netscape) source code in 1998 cited The Cathedral and the Bazaar as "independent validation" of ideas proposed by Eric Hahn and Jamie Zawinski. Hahn also described the book as "clearly influential".
	* co-founded the Open Source Initiative in 1998
5. Git - Github
	* Created by Linus
	* Made accessible by Github
	* Distributed Source Control.


## Benefits of F/OSS for the Community

Academic theorizing on individual motivations for participating in 
F/OSS projects has posited that external motivational factors in the form of extrinsic benefits 
(e.g.; better jobs, career advancement) are the main drivers of effort. We find in contrast, that 
enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation, namely how creative a person feels when working on the 
project, is the strongest and most pervasive driver. We also find that user need, intellectual 
stimulation derived from writing code, and improving programming skills are top motivators for 
project participation. A majority of our respondents are skilled and experienced professionals 
working in IT-related jobs, with approximately 40 percent being paid to participate in the F/OSS 
project

## Benefits of F/OSD for the Community

* A rising tide lifts all boats
	* New designers need to learn
	* Old designers need to adapt
* Innovation happens most frequetly in connected environments
* Satisfaction
* Natural consequence
	* Better exposure
	* Jobs you want
	* Learn to work together
	* A healthier, more unified community as a whole
	
## Barriers to F/OSD

* Pride
	* Worried about being judged
	* Looking for glory and credit
* Unreasonable greed
* A lack of desire
* Overworked

* Tooling
	* Source control
	* Distributed
* File Format


## Where is F/OSD Living Today

* Dribbble rebound
* The noun project
* Creative Commons License

## A Humble Manifesto

* I will find opportunities to design in the open
* I will share my experiences, good and bad
* I will carve out time, to work on projects that I find meaningful
* I will be openly participate in design process discussions
* I will learn how to work with someone by choice







Quotes
> Open source is like Prison Break for developers, can we put a fence around this?” – Audience member in IT management. “No you shouldn’t. Let them free.  Just put a radio tracking collar on them. – Analyst - See more at: http://www.activestate.com/blog/2010/03/top-10-quotes-osbc-2010-and-what-it-means-open-source-developers#sthash.cD1wW7Ar.dpuf





1. Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
2. Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
3. Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks' The Mythical Man Month)
4. If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
5. When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
6. Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
7. Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.
8. Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
9. Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
10. If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
11. The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
12. Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
13. Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry)
14. Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
15. When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
16. When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.
17. A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
18. To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
19. Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.
